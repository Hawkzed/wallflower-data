    "description": "<i>Your time on Hercynia has always been marked by a kind of… searching. A connection to the planet, to something alive there. At night, when it is quiet, you think you can hear it best: your name, or a whisper that speaks something deeper, in the voice of another.<br>You don’t feel any fear when you hear it; you feel complete.<br>Time to find the distant speaker.</i><br>Whether your character is born offworld and comes to Hercynia without knowledge of the Egregorians, Witness, or any of the planet’s history, or if you were born in Evergreen or one of the United Cities, your character can be an empath. An empath is a human that can not only register when Witness is being shared, but begin to understand it and, with some training, be able to add their own subjectivity to it.<br>Mere exposure to Hercynia is enough for a character to become an empath. Nobody is ‘born’ an empath - it is a learned process, not an inherited one. Though, like all skills, some people find it easier than others, anyone can potentially become one. Normally empaths bond with Egregorians - there are many examples of such in the United Cities. Rarely, empaths can form bonds with other humans - a process that is as rare and wondrous to Egregorians as it is to the humans undergoing it, and one that also suggests that a human extension of Witness may be possible or nascent.",
