Working with Visual convinced me of this: it’s their job to translate our work to sales, and they could not. If the translator cannot understand the text... then who are they to re-write it? Who is the reader to attempt to access it? I conclude my summary with this: mothball the platform. There are less terrible paths we can walk.",
